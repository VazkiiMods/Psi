*Psi Starless* is a fork of [the original Psi mod](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Psi) made for the latest Minecraft version with some modified features. I don't have any plans on uploading this on CurseForge or any other platform, as it was originally made for personal use. **Unless Vazkii's mod has not yet been ported to your version, you should use the original mod.**

This mod is about spell programming with the use of CAD.

## Installing

This mod requires [Patchouli](https://github.com/Vazkii/Patchouli).

1. Download an artifact of the latest successful build.
2. Extract the artifact and find a compiled file without any suffix (for example `psi-starless-1.19.2-a3de09e`).
3. Put the file in your `mods` folder.
